# Boruvka's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree

This project implements Boruvka's algorithm in C++ to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph. Boruvka's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used for finding MSTs in a graph. It works by repeatedly growing the MST by adding the smallest edge connecting two distinct components of the graph until all vertices are connected.

## Features

- Input graph is read from a file specified by the user.
- Computes the minimum spanning tree of the input graph using Boruvka's algorithm.
- Outputs the edges of the minimum spanning tree.

## Applications

Boruvka's algorithm has several applications in various domains, including:

- **Network Design:** Finding the minimum spanning tree helps in designing efficient communication networks with minimal cost.
- **Clustering:** It can be used to identify clusters or connected components in a graph.
- **Image Segmentation:** Boruvka's algorithm can be applied to segment images based on similarity measures between pixels.
